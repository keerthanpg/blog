# Hello! 

I am Keerthana, a graduate student of robotics at Carnegie Mellon who's trying to document bits of her life by moulding words. I write, therefore I am. 

                    
On regular days, I spend 60+ hours a week working towards my degree, mostly converting coffee and sleeplessness to code. I am a start-up enthusiast who likes to follow up on politics and policy in India, read non-fiction and have recently taken to writing. Wielding the pen makes me feel powerful.
